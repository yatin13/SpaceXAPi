This is a simple project that uses react along with some of its hooks that basically renders space x api and is fully responsive.

For the functionality,I use 2 step approach:

1. To use 2 different components 1 for rendering buttons and another one for rendering API.
2. Adding useState and onClick on buttons and passing over data from Button(Filter component) to Apidata Component

We can also run the project my following command:

`npm start`

I have not used server side rendering here due to some technical issues.

To improve functionality of my app to users I have used lighthouse reports(provided by Chrome Dev Tools)
These are the improved reports that I am pasting here:
